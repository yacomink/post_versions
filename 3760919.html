<p>Arizona State University is pioneering a massive, open, fully-online freshman year, allowing anybody to take a year of classes for credit at a reduced cost, the university announced today. The so-called "Global Freshman Academy," a partnership with the nonprofit EdX, is the latest step in ASU's bid for rapid online expansion. It is also part of a movement by EdX and others to give real-world value to massively-open online courses, or MOOCs, which traditionally offer no course credit.</p>
<p>ASU's Global Freshman Academy has no application process, no cap on the number of students who can enroll, and, initially, no charge except for a $45-per-course fee to verify students' identities. After completing the courses, online students who want to use the courses as credits towards their freshman year will have to pay significantly more, some $6,000 for eight classes. The university says the credits will transfer to any school that accepts ASU credits.</p>
<p>ASU and EdX trumpeted the Freshman Academy as part of a mission of increased access. But a spokesman said that it was unclear whether students could use federal financial aid, such as Pell Grants, to pay for the credits. That could ultimately mean that the cost would be thousands of dollars more than at</p>
<p>ASU has put rapid growth, especially in the online world, at the center of its strategy, hoping in part compete with for-profit colleges that have traditionally dominated the sphere. The university grabbed headlines last year when it announced a partnership with Starbucks that would allow the company's thousands of baristas nationwide to finish their bachelor's degrees for free at ASU Online. Lured by the prospect of more than doubling its fledgling online enrollment, ASU picked up the bulk of the tab for Starbucks employees by heavily discounting tuition.</p>
<p>The university now has 13,000 full-time online students, and has said it hopes to swell to more than 100,000 by 2020.</p>
<p>“If the University of Phoenix can have 400,000 students, most of them online, why can’t a real university like Arizona State grow to a similar size?" Phil Regier, the dean of ASU’s online programs, said in an interview with BuzzFeed News last year.<br></p>
<p>For ASU, the Global Freshman Academy will be another step in that direction. THE HOPE IS FOR STUDENTS TO ENROLL</p>
