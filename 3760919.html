<p>Arizona State University is pioneering a massive, open, fully-online freshman year, allowing anybody to take classes for credit at a reduced cost, the university announced today. The so-called “Global Freshman Academy” has no application process, no cap on the number of students who can enroll, and, initially, costs nothing but a $45-per-course verification fee.</p>
<p>A partnership with the nonprofit EdX platform, the unprecedented program is the latest step in ASU’s bid to become a dominant force in online education. It is also part of a push by EdX and others to give real-world value to massively-open online courses, or MOOCs, which traditionally offer no course credit.</p>
<p>ASU and EdX are trumpeting the Freshman Academy as part of a joint mission of increased access, allowing students to bypass many of the barriers that students traditionally face in their first years of college.</p>
<p>Rachel Fishman, a senior policy analyst at the New America Foundation, suggested that the structure of current federal regulations may bar students from receiving federal aid for programs like the Freshman Academy. “Existing rules and regulations clearly state that federal financial aid cannot be used to pay for evaluating prior student work,” she wrote in <a href="http://www.edcentral.org/global-freshman-academy/">a blog post</a>.</p>
<p>“There’s a significant risk associated” with the way traditional universities are structured, said Anant Agarwal, the CEO of EdX. “You have to pay a large sum of money up-front for a course you may not pass. There are big geographic risks when you move to a new place. We’re trying to make the steep slope to college much more gentle.”</p>
<p>For poor students, however, the venture may not be as accessible as it seems. After completing eight ASU courses through EdX’s platform, students who want to use the classes as credits towards their freshman year will have to pay about $6,000.</p>
<p>But the university has yet to establish whether students could use federal financial aid to pay for the credits, according to an EdX spokesman. For a poor student eligible for aid like Pell Grants, the Freshman Academy could cost thousands more than a year at a community college, which typically costs about $3,000, or even a state university.</p>

<p>ASU has put rapid growth, especially in the online world, at the center of its strategy, hoping in part compete with for-profit colleges that have traditionally dominated the sphere. The university grabbed headlines last year when it announced a partnership with Starbucks that would allow the company's thousands of baristas nationwide to finish their bachelor's degrees for free at ASU Online. Lured by the prospect of more than doubling its fledgling online enrollment, ASU picked up the bulk of the tab for Starbucks employees by heavily discounting tuition.</p>
<p>ASU Online now has 13,000 full-time students, and has said it hopes to swell to more than 100,000 by 2020.</p>
<p>The Global Freshman Academy will likely be a boost for that</p>
<p>For EdX, a leading online provider of MOOCs built through a joint partnership between Harvard and Stanford Universities,</p>
