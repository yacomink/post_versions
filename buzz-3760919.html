<p>Arizona State University is pioneering a massive, open fully-online freshman year, the university announced yesterday, allowing anybody to take for-credit classes without applying to the school and at a fraction of the cost of a traditional first year of college. The so-called "Global Freshman Academy" is part of a partnership with EdX, the nonprofit MOOC provider.</p>
<p>ASU has put rapid expansion, especially in the online sphere, at the center of its strategy, hoping to compete with for-profit colleges as well as other state universities. The university grabbed headlines last year when it announced a partnership with Starbucks that would allow the company's thousands of baristas nationwide to finish their bachelor's degrees at ASU Online for free. Lured by the prospect of more than doubling its fledgling online enrollment, ASU picked up the bulk of the tab for Starbucks employees.</p>
<p>The university now has 13,000 full-time online students, and has said it hopes to swell to more than 100,000 by 2020. Earlier this year, Starbucks announced it was expanding its partnership with ASU to include scholarships for all four years of its employees' education, which will likely deliver yet another enrollment boost.</p>
<p>“If the University of Phoenix can have 400,000 students, most of them online, why can’t a real university like Arizona State grow to a similar size?" Phil Regier, the dean of ASU’s online programs, said in an interview with BuzzFeed News last year.<br></p>
<p>For ASU, the Global Freshman Academy will be another step in that direction. There is no application process, no cap on the number of students who can enroll, and, initially, no charge except for a $45-per-course fee to verify students' identities. Online students who want to convert the courses to credit,</p>
<p>It remains unclear</p>
