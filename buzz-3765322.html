<p>In the wake of the abrupt closure of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges on Sunday, the Education Department released official guidance suggesting that the school's 16,000 students transfer to a number of the industry's most troubled for-profit schools.</p>
<p>Among the schools on the Education Department's list of "<a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sites/default/files/corinthian-local-schools.pdf">viable transfer options</a>" released to Corinthian students are ITT Technical Institute, which is facing a predatory lending lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and investigations by 17 state attorneys general, and schools owned by EDMC, which is being investigated by the Department of Justice. Teetering on the edge of financial instability, EDMC has instituted mass layoffs and sold off several of its Art Institutes campuses.</p>
<p>The department also pointed students towards schools owned by Career Education Corporation, which settled with the New York Attorney General for $10 million over allegations that it had misled students and falsified education records. The school has a checkered past of investigations by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Corinthian, which had been on shaky financial ground for years, was compelled to sell off its campuses last July in the wake of lawsuits by three state attorneys general and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The Education Department struck a fatal blow to the 30 Corinthian was unable to sell earlier this month by imposing a $30 million fine for misrepresentations to students.<br></p>
<p>After Corinthian abruptly shuttered 30 campuses, some 16,000 students were left stranded partway through their degrees.</p>
