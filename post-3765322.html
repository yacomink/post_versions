<p>In the wake of the abrupt closure of the for-profit Corinthian Colleges on Sunday, the Education Department released official guidance suggesting that the school's 16,000 students transfer to a number of the industry's most troubled for-profit schools.</p>
<p>Among the schools on the Education Department's list of "<a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sites/default/files/corinthian-local-schools.pdf">viable transfer options</a>" released to Corinthian students are ITT Technical Institute, which is facing a predatory lending lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and investigations by 17 state attorneys general, and schools owned by EDMC, which is being investigated by the Department of Justice. Teetering on the edge of financial instability, EDMC has instituted mass layoffs and sold off several of its Art Institutes campuses.</p>
<p>In dealing with the thousands of Corinthian students left stranded partway through their degrees, the Education Department is facing a complex task. Corinthian's credits are traditionally not transferrable to most schools — even community colleges — because of its accreditation. Most schools that accept Corinthian's credits are themselves for-profits.</p>
<p>In releasing a list of "viable transfer options for students," the Education Department has a responsibility to "give them a full range of choices and allowing them to make those choices themselves," said David Bergeron of the Center for American Progress. "It's crucially important that we empower students to be in control of their educational experiences."</p>
<p>But Dick Durbin, a Democratic senator, spoke out against the inclusion the most troubled for-profits in the department's list. In a speech to Congress today, Durbin said, “Has the Department of Education learned nothing? How in good faith can they tell these Corinthian students – who just had their college disappear and are sitting on a pile of debt – that these are viable transfer options for their students?”</p>
